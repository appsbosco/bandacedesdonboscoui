    "history_title": "History of the CEDES Don Bosco Band",
    "history_p1": "Founded in 1965, the CEDES Don Bosco Band (BCDB) was created alongside the founding of the Don Bosco Technical School, originally located in Barrio Don Bosco, San José, Costa Rica. From the very beginning, the band has been a symbol of excellence, discipline, and social transformation through music. In 2001, with the school's move to the modern CEDES Don Bosco educational complex in Concepción Arriba de Alajuelita, the band was strengthened as a national artistic benchmark.",
    "history_p2": "Throughout nearly six decades of history, the band has been led by only three directors, showing an unusual level of stability. Its current director is Maestro Luis Fernando Solano Gamboa, who leads with passion and commitment, fostering not only musicians but also integral human beings.",
    "history_p3": "Today, the band is made up of 280 members, including active students and alumni from the Centro de Enseñanza Don Bosco, Escuela San Juan Bosco, and Colegio Técnico Profesional Don Bosco. Members range in age from 8 to 24, with many coming from communities in vulnerable situations.",
